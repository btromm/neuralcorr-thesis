# Literature Review Outline
## Ion channel correlations in neurons with complex homeostatic mechanisms
### An integrative full review

Note to self:
A good literature review discusses the literature critically, identifying methodological problems, and points out gaps in research (Pautasso 2013)

Goals:  
Readers should be able to identify the major achievements in the reviewed field, the main areas of debate, and the outstanding research questions (Pautasso 2013)

Outline:
General intro of context and recapitulation of main points/take-home messages

**NOTE:** Different categories may have repeats of the same papers from different categories. This is for the purpose of me preserving my sanity -- many papers in this field explore a variety of topics, and I am trying to outline them all to create a rough draft of the final review. Repeats will be denoted with ***bolded italics***.  
**ANOTHER NOTE:** Some papers may have repeats of the same *words* used in other papers. This is because I'm a liar, and a thief, and many general ideas are repeated across papers and summed up in single sentences in review papers.  
**LAST NOTE (I swear):** Not all the words on these pages are my own and this outline is **not** meant to be read or received as my own true work, and is only public for the purpose of creating a transparent environment around which we can converse about both the topics at hand, as well as the pedagogical truths lying within the formation of theses, especially for undergraduates (like me!) who have never done something like this before. This is public only in the spirit of radical honesty and transparency about what I'm doing with my life. <3

Now, onto the outline:

## Animal Models  
### Stomatogastric ganglion  
- **Kilman and Marder 1996**  
    - Stomatogastric ganglion contains 25-26 identifiable neurons  
- Perhaps it's wise to find some other papers which identify the types of neurons?  
- Find paper detailing the rhythms of the pyloric network  

## Neuronal Identity  
- **Maynard and Dando 1974**  
    - Neurons are identifiable on the basis of anatomical projections  
- **Hobert et al., 2010**
    - Neuronal identity depends on molecular composition that determines morphology and function
    - Regulated on multiple levels


## Cell Specificity
- **Desai et al., 1999**
   - Each cell type has different sensitivity to activity
- **Schulz et al., 2007**
    - Ion channel correlations are cell-type specific and each identified neuron might display a characteristic set of correlations
        - These characteristic sets of correlations suggest a good marker for cell identity and/or activity
- **Lammel etal., 2008**
    - In dopaminergic midbrain, ratios of expression of several dopaminergic marker genes were cell-type specific, corresponding to neurons pattern of projection
- **Krenz et al., 2015**
    - Tonic nanomolar concentrations of other amines can regulate I_A and I_H in a cell-type specific manner
- **Schulz et al., 2007**
    - No overlap in expression patterns of unique cell types
    - Each cell type has a unique complement of coordinated channel expression, both qualitatively and quantitatively
- **Temporal et al., 2012**
    - Relative abundances of conductance channels differ over cell types

    
## Variability
- **Goldman et al., 2001, Leao et al., 2012, Olypher & Calabrese 2007, Ransdell et al., 2012, Liss et al., 2001, Swensen and Bean 2005, Roffman et al., 2012, Schulz et al., 2006, Park et al., 2013, Routh et al., 2017**
    - Ionic current levels in populations of identical neurons are extremely variable
- **Archard et al., 2006, Golowasch et al., 2002, Marder & Goaillard 2006, Prinz et al., 2003, Prinz et al., 2004, Schulz et al., 2006, Tobin and Calabrese 2006, Swensen and Bean 2005, Taylor et al., 2006, Taylor et al., 2009**

- **Schulz et al., 2006, Swensen and Bean 2005, Liu et al., 1998, Golowasch et al., 1999**
    - Values of individual channel densities can vary severalfold across cells of the same type
- **Marder 2011, Hamood and Marder 2014, Marder and Goaillard 2006**
    - Neurons of a given type are not uniform in the distribution of ionic conductances used to generate their output
- **Golowasch et al., 2002, Prinz et al., 2004, Goldman et al., 2001**
    - Similar electrophysiological patterns of activity can result from very different sets of underlying conductance densities
- **Liu et al., 1998**
    - A high degree of variability is consistent with a constant pattern of activity
### Hypotheses of Variation
- **Marder & Goaillard 2006, Schulz et al., 2006**
    - Variability in channel expression is a reflection of tuning to maintain target activity
- **Ozbudak et al., 2002, Raser & O'Shea 2005**
    - Variability is an inherent stochasticity relevant to infrequent molecular events and small numbers of molecules
- **Blake et al., 2003, Volfson et al., 2006**
    - Variability in regulatory sequences and transcriptional machinery leads to variation in gene transcription
- **Marder and Rehm 2005, Rehm et al., 2008, Rehm et al., 2008**
    - Activity-dependent developmental tuning of STG neurons may give rise to STG networks that are already variable across individuals



## Homeostasis  
- **May'ayan et al., 2005, Ma'ayan et al., 2005**
    - Compensatory mechanisms can occur as a way to stabilize cell function on a long-term basis
- **Desai et al., 1999, Golowasch et al., 1999, LeMasson et al., 1993, Turrigiano et al., 1994, Turrigiano et al., 1995, Turrigiano 1999, Turrigiano et al., 1998**
    - Neurons can maintain cell activity despite perturbations
- **Daoudal and Debanne 2003, Davis 2006, Frick and Johnston 2005, Haedo and Golowasch 2006, Thoby-Brisson and Simmers 2002, Turrigiano and Nelson 2004, Zhang and Linden 2003**
    - Neurons express plasticity in intrinsic properties and excitability in order to maintain functional output over long time-scales
- **Zhang and Linden 2003**
    - Neurons maintain functional output by changing ionic channel properties
- **Khorkova and Golowasch 2007, Cudmore and Turrigiano 2004, Desai et al., 1999, Li et al., 2004, Loebricha and Nedivi 2009, Zhang and Linden 2003**
    - Plasticity in neuronal excitability results from activity-independent mechanisms (Khorkova)
    - Plasticity in neuronal excitability results from activity-dependent mechanisms (rest of them)
    - Plasticity can be regulated by:
        - **Misonou et al., 2006, Daoudal et al., 2003**
            - Regulation of channel properties
        - **Shah et al., 2010, Misonou et al., 2004**

            - Association of channels with modifying subunits
- **Zhang et al., 2009, Zhang and Golowasch 2011**
    - Difficult to separate the impacts of activity-dependent changes and neuromodulatory changes
### Neuromodulation  
- **Khorkova and Golowasch 2007**

- **Ransdell et al., 2013**
    - TEA causes LCs to lose conserved output and produce divergent voltage responses, and network rhythm becomes desynchronized in LC.
### Activity-Dependence
- **LeMasson et al., 1993, Liu et al., 1998, Stemmler and Koch 1999**
    - Control of ion channel protein turnover must be regulated by feedback mechanisms related to the firing properties of the neuron
- **Daoudal et al., 2003**
    - Compensatory changes in neuronal excitability tend to occur as a result of prolonged changes in firing activity
- **Temporal et al., 2014**
    - Direct activity-dependent feedback to the level of channel mRNAs
    - Decoupling loss of activity and neuromodulation by decentralizing STG neurons
        - Decentralization significantly changes channel mRNA abundance in PD and loss of characteristic channel mRNA correlations
        - Correlations can be rescued by application of pilocarpine, but are maintained with TTX as well
            - Activity and neuromodulation are both required for homeostasis
- **Krenz et al., 2013, Krenz et al., 2015, Rodgers et al., 2011**
    - High-affinity D1Rs respond to dopamine at far lower concentrations to mediate response that can regulate I_H in an activity-dependent manner
- **Turrigiano et al., 1994, Turrigiano et al., 1995**
    - Chronically isolated lobster STG neurons generate endogenous bursting as a result of changes in expression of intrinsic membrane conductances
    - Changes are activity-dependent
    - Mediated at least in part by intracellular calcium concentration (as a measure of activity)
- **Haedo and Golowasch 2006**
    - Changes in expression of intrinsic membrane conductances are found in the STG
- **Thoby-Brisson and Simmers 1998, Thoby-Brisson and Simmers 2002**
    - Recovery of function of rhythmicity in lobster STG neurons associated with downregulation of K+ and upregulation of H- currents
- **Zhang et al., 2009, Golowasch et al., 1999, Mizrahi et al., 2001**
    - Same effect as Thoby-Brisson reported in crustacean STG, but differing levels of loss and gain of function (**Hamood et al., 2015**)
- **Ransdell et al., 2013, Lane et al., 2016**
    - Synchrony restored within 1 hour via 2 conductance changes acting synergistically
- **Temporal et al., 2011**
    - Synaptic activity does not influence correlated expression of ionic currents at mRNA or conductance levels in LP and PD at minimum
### Mechanisms of Homeostasis
- **Rodgers et al., 2013**
    - Modulation can provide flexibility & stability through self-stabilizing feedback loops to maintain I_A:I_H ratio
    - low levels of constitutive modulation can potentiate activity-dependent regulation of conductances
- **O'Leary et al., 2013**
    -  Activity-dependent tuning rules can reliable result in consistent desired activity
- **Zhang et al., 2009**
    - Recovery of rhythmic output after decentralization is mediated by activity- and neuromodulator-dependent pathways
- **Liu et al., 1998, LeMasson et al., 1993, Turrigiano and Nelson 2004**
    - Electrical activity is homeostatically regulated by a target level of excitability

    - Neuromodulation can work on long time-scales to influence coregulation of pairs of ionic currents and channel mRNAs in STG cells
- **Schulz et al., 2007**
    - Neuronal identity is captured in the patterns of expression in multiple channel genes & the outcome ensures appropriate levels of activity
    - Cellular output is determined by characteristic sets of correlated expressions of ion channel genes, suggesting the presence of cell type-specific mechanisms for unique transcriptional coregulation among the same common pool of channel genes
- **Olypher et al., 2007, Rotstein et al., 2017, Rotstein et al., 2016, Hudson and Prinz 2010, O'Leary and Marder 2016, Lamb and Calabrese 2013**
    - Ionic current amplitude correlations allow neurons of any type or species to express similar patterns of activity despite expressing widely different ionic current amplitudes by maintaining constant relative levels of different current types
- **Schulz et al., 2007, MacLean et al., 2005**
    - Correlations between conductances may represent mechanism by which certain ratios that can maintain target activity can be enforced
- **Peng and Wu 2007**
    - Removal of I_Ca causes homeostatic decrease in I_KCa and I_A that does not involve changes in channel kinetic properties
- **MacLean et al., 2005, MacLean et al., 2003**
    - I_H and I_A occur in a set ratio in their amplitudes
- **Ball et al., 2010, Burdakov 2005, MacLean et al., 2005**
    - Coexpression of ionic currents can stabilize specific activity features
    - *Ball-specific* Coregulation of ion channel conductances preserves output in a computational model of crustacean model neuron

    - functional link b/w regulation at mRNA level and membrane conductance
    - Some channels display high correlation at conductance level but not mRNA level, indicating regulation downstream of transcription (BKKCa/Shal in LP, Shal/H in PD)
        - Correlations of mRNA type could be result of posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA stability
            - Transcription itself was not measured in this study

- **Ball et al., 2010, Burdakov 2005, Khorkova and Golowasch 2007, MacLean et al., 2005**
    - Codependence is related to homeostatic regulation of function
- **Khorkova and Golowasch 2007**
    - Activity has no effect on the correlated expression of ion channels
    - Ionic conductances
- **Temporal et al., 2014**
    - Neuromodulation is essential for maintaining correlations between channel mRNAs
        - Decentralization without exogenous neuromodulatory input breaks correlations
        - Correlations can be rescued by application of pilocarpine, but are maintained with TTX as well
        - Treatment with picrotoxin results in varied expression patterns as compensation for loss of inhibitory glutamatergic interactions
        - Treatment with TTX (block innate neuromodulation) + pilocarpine (engages samemodulatory-evoked mixed cation conductance as many endogenous STG peptide modulators) preserves channel mRNA correlations

- **MacLean et al., 2005, MacLean et al., 2003**

- **Lane et al., 2016**
    - Blockade of potassium currents with TEA drives motor neurons in the crustacean cardiac ganglion to hyperexcitability
    - Desynchronization of activity occurs due to differential impacts of TEA. Network activity is restored over 30-60 minutes due to compensatory increase in I_A (restore excitability, helps re-synchronize) and concomitant increase in electrical coupling (ensures restoration of synchrony)
- **Tran et al., 2019**
    - Ionic current correlations are ubiquitous across phyla
    - Multiple set-points along correlation lines that satisfy functional requirements of neurons under certain conditions can be regulated to various degrees, revealed as changes in correlation slopes (dependent on neuromodulation)
    - Circadian rhythms can modulate ionic conductance correlations in hippocampal granule cells
    - Correlations only appear to involve voltage-dependent conductances and don't involve leak conductances (in both crustacean and mammalian neurons)
    - However, leak conductances are generally defined as the general input conductance of neurons, and were not characterized more specifically -- this could be masking significant correlations
    - Correlated channels
        - GKd/GNa, GKd/GKir, GNa/GKir, GA/GKd, GA/GH, GHTK/GH, GHTK/GA (last two correlated in centralized STG neurons but not decentralized
            - Some correlations are dependent on neuromodulatory input and some aren't
- **Temporal et al., 2011**
    - Coexpression of ion channels is not influenced by synaptic activity
    - Coexpression of ionic currents is one way to reduce global variability of the system by linking multiple highly variable currents to each other
    - Proctolin can fully reverse all effects of decentralization on conductance correlationsin PD neurons
