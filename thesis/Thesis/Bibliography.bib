	abstract = {The number and type of ion channels present in the membrane determines the electrophysiological function of every neuron. In many species, stereotyped output of neurons often persists for years [1], and ion channel dysregulation can change these properties to cause severe neurological disorders [2-4]. Thus, a fundamental question is how do neurons coordinate channel expression to uphold their firing patterns over long timescales [1, 5]? One major hypothesis purports that neurons homeostatically regulate their ongoing activity through mechanisms that link membrane voltage to expression relationships among ion channels [6-10]. However, experimentally establishing this feedback loop for the control of expression relationships has been a challenge: manipulations that aim to test for voltage feedback invariably disrupt trophic signaling from synaptic transmission and neuromodulation in addition to activity [9, 11, 12]. Further, neuronal activity often relies critically on these chemical mediators, obscuring the contribution of voltage activity of the membrane per se in forming the channel relationships that determine neuronal output [6, 13]. To resolve this, we isolated an identifiable neuron in crustaceans and then either kept this neuron silent or used a long-term voltage clamp protocol to artificially maintain activity. We found that physiological voltage activity-independent of all known forms of synaptic and neuromodulatory feedback-maintains most channel {mRNA} relationships, while metabotropic influences may play a relatively smaller role. Thus, ion channel relationships likely needed to maintain neuronal identity are actively and continually regulated at least in part at the level of channel {mRNAs} through feedback by membrane voltage.},

	abstract = {Six neuromodulators [proctolin, Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia, crustacean cardioactive peptide ({CCAP}), red pigment-concentrating hormone, {TNRNFLRFamide}, and pilocarpine] converge onto the same voltage-dependent inward current in stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}) neurons of the crab C. borealis. We show here that each of these modulators acts on a distinct subset of pyloric network neurons in the {STG}. To ask whether the differences in cell targets could account for their differential effects on the pyloric rhythm, we systematically compared the motor patterns produced by proctolin and {CCAP}. The motor patterns produced in proctolin and {CCAP} differed quantitatively in a number of ways. Proctolin and {CCAP} both act on the lateral pyloric neuron and the inferior cardiac neuron. Proctolin additionally acts on the pyloric dilator ({PD}) neurons, the pyloric ({PY}) neurons, and the ventricular dilator neuron. Using the dynamic clamp, we introduced an artificial peptide-elicited current into the {PD} and {PY} neurons, in the presence of {CCAP}, and converted the {CCAP} rhythm into a rhythm that was statistically similar to that seen in proctolin. This suggests that the differences in the network effects of these two modulators can primarily be attributed to the known differential distributions of their receptors onto distinct subsets of neurons, despite the fact that they activate the same current.},

	abstract = {Central pattern generators ({CPGs}) are neuronal networks that control vitally important rhythmic behaviors including breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. Understanding how {CPGs} recover activity after their rhythmic activity is disrupted has important theoretical and practical implications. Previous experimental and modeling studies indicated that rhythm recovery after central neuromodulatory input loss (decentralization) could be based entirely on activity-dependent mechanisms, but recent evidence of long-term conductance regulation by neuromodulators suggest that neuromodulator-dependent mechanisms may also be involved. Here we examined the effects of altering activity and the neuromodulatory environment before decentralization of the pyloric {CPG} in Cancer borealis on the initial phase of rhythmic activity recovery after decentralization. We found that pretreatments altering the network activity through shifting the ionic balance or the membrane potential of pyloric pacemaker neurons reduced the delay of recovery initiation after decentralization, consistent with the recovery process being triggered already during the pretreatment period through an activity-dependent mechanism. However, we observed that pretreatment with neuromodulators {GABA} and proctolin, acting via metabotropic receptors, also affected the initial phase of the recovery of pyloric activity after decentralization. Their distinct effects appear to result from interactions of their metabotropic effects with their effects on neuronal activity. Thus we show that the initial phase of the recovery process can be accounted for by the existence of distinct activity-and neuromodulator-dependent pathways. We propose a computational model that includes activity- and neuromodulator-dependent mechanisms of the activity recovery process, which successfully explains the experimental observations and predicts the results of key biological experiments.},

	abstract = {The stomatogastric nervous system ({STNS}) of the embryonic lobster is rhythmically active prior to hatching, before the network is needed for feeding. In the adult lobster, two rhythms are typically observed: the slow gastric mill rhythm and the more rapid pyloric rhythm. In the embryo, rhythmic activity in both embryonic gastric mill and pyloric neurons occurs at a similar frequency, which is slightly slower than the adult pyloric frequency. However, embryonic motor patterns are highly irregular, making traditional burst quantification difficult. Consequently, we used spectral analysis to analyze long stretches of simultaneous recordings from muscles innervated by gastric and pyloric neurons in the embryo. This analysis revealed that embryonic gastric mill neurons intermittently produced pauses and periods of slower activity not seen in the recordings of the output from embryonic pyloric neurons. The slow activity in the embryonic gastric mill neurons increased in response to the exogenous application of Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide 1a ({CabTRP}), a modulatory peptide that appears in the inputs to the stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}) late in larval development. These results suggest that the {STG} network can express adult-like rhythmic behavior before fully differentiated adult motor patterns are observed, and that the maturation of the neuromodulatory inputs is likely to play a role in the eventual establishment of the adult motor patterns.},

We compared the effects of neuromodulators on isolated embryonic and adult {STG} of the lobster, Homarus americanus. Bath application of Val1-{SIFamide}, a peptide whose expression is different in embryos and adults, activated different neuron classes in embryos and adults. Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide 1a, a peptide that does not appear in the terminals of modulatory neurons in the {STG} until after embryonic development, also produced different motor patterns in embryos and adults. In contrast, red pigment concentrating hormone, a peptide with a similar distribution in the {STNS} across development, produced similar motor patterns in embryonic and adult {STG}. Proctolin, serotonin, and allatostatin were also physiologically active on the isolated embryonic {STG}. Together, these results demonstrate that receptors to many neuromodulators are present and functional on {STG} neurons before the motor patterns of the stomatogastric nervous system are mature. Moreover, neuromodulator responses change during development, perhaps contributing to the maturation of the output from the stomatogastric nervous system.},

Central pattern generators, such as those of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}), are able to robustly maintain their functionality over a wide range of burst periods. Previous experimental work involving extracellular recordings of the pyloric pattern of the {STG} has demonstrated that as the burst period varies, the inter-neuronal delays are altered proportionally, resulting in burst phases that are roughly invariant. The question whether spike delays within bursts are also proportional to pyloric period has not been explored in detail. The mechanism by which the pyloric neurons accomplish phase maintenance is currently not obvious. Previous studies suggest that the co-regulation of certain ion channel properties may play a role in governing neuronal activity. Here, we observed in long-term recordings of the pyloric rhythm that spike delays can vary proportionally with burst period, so that spike phase is maintained. We then used a conductance-based model neuron to determine whether co-varying ionic membrane conductances results in neural output that emulates the experimentally observed phenomenon of spike phase maintenance. Next, we utilized a model neuron database to determine whether conductance correlations exist in model neuron populations with highly maintained spike phases. We found that co-varying certain conductances, including the sodium and transient calcium conductance pair, causes the model neuron to maintain a specific spike phase pattern. Results indicate a possible relationship between conductance co-regulation and phase maintenance in {STG} neurons.},

It contains the extensively modulated central pattern generators that drive the gastric mill (chewing) and pyloric (food filtering) rhythms. Neuromodulators affect all stages of neuronal processing in this system, from membrane currents and synaptic transmission in network neurons to the properties of the effector muscles. The ease with which distinct neurons are identified and their activity is recorded in this system has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by which neuromodulators affect their target cells and modulatory neuron function. Recent evidence suggests that neuromodulators are involved in homeostatic processes and that the modulatory system itself is under modulatory control, a fascinating topic whose surface has been barely scratched.

We previously examined {DA}-enabled long-term intrinsic plasticity in a single identified neuron.

Here, we repeated these experiments with pharmacological and peptide inhibitors to determine the cellular processes and signaling proteins involved. We discovered that the persistent, {DA}-induced activity-independent (I A) and activity-dependent (I h) changes in ionic conductances depended upon many of the same elements that enable long-term synaptic plasticity, including: the D1R-protein kinase A ({PKA}) axis, {RNA} polymerase {II} transcription, {RNA} interference ({RNAi}), and mechanistic target of rapamycin ({mTOR})-dependent translation.

A 10 min application of 5-100 μM {DA} decreases {LP} {IA} by producing a decrease in {IA} maximal conductance (Gmax) and a depolarizing shift in {IA} voltage dependence through a {cAMP}-Protein kinase A ({PKA}) dependent mechanism. Alternatively, a 1 hr application of {DA} (≥5 {nM}) generates a persistent (measured 4 hr after {DA} washout) increase in {IA} Gmax in the same neuron, through a mechanistic target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) dependent translational mechanism. We examined the dose, time and protein dependencies of the persistent {DA} effect.{ResultsWe} found that disrupting normal modulatory tone decreased {LP} {IA}. Addition of 500 {pM}-5 {nM} {DA} to the saline for 1 hr prevented this decrease, and in the case of a 5 {nM} {DA} application, the effect was sustained for {\textgreater}4 hrs after {DA} removal. To determine if increased {cAMP} mediated the persistent effect of 5nM {DA}, we applied the {cAMP} analog, 8-bromo-{cAMP} alone or with rapamycin for 1 hr, followed by wash and {TEVC}. 8-bromo-{cAMP} induced an increase in {IA} Gmax, which was blocked by rapamycin. Next we tested the roles of {PKA} and guanine exchange factor protein activated by {cAMP} ({ePACs}) in the {DA}-induced persistent change in {IA} using the {PKA} specific antagonist Rp-{cAMP} and the {ePAC} specific agonist 8-{pCPT}-2′-O-Me-{cAMP}. The {PKA} antagonist blocked the {DA} induced increases in {LP} {IA} Gmax, whereas the {ePAC} agonist did not induce an increase in {LP} {IA} Gmax. Finally we tested whether extracellular signal regulated kinase (Erk) activity was necessary for the persistent effect by co-application of Erk antagonists {PD}98059 or U0126 with {DA}. Erk antagonism blocked the {DA} induced persistent increase in {LP} {IA}.{ConclusionsThese} data suggest that dopaminergic tone regulates ion channel density in a concentration and time dependent manner.

Additionally, since {DA} is released from open synapses and reuptake mechanisms are not nearby, tonic nanomolar {DA} exists in the extracellular space. Do phasic and tonic transmissions similarly regulate voltage-dependent ionic conductances in a given neuron? It was previously shown that {DA} could immediately alter the transient potassium current ({IA}) of identified neurons in the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus. Here we show that {DA} can also persistently alter {IA}, and that the immediate and persistent effects of {DA} oppose one another. The lateral pyloric ({LP}) neuron exclusively expresses type 1 {DA} receptors (D1Rs). Micromolar {DA} produces immediate depolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of {LP} {IA}, whereas tonic nanomolar {DA} produces a persistent increase in {LP} {IA} maximal conductance (Gmax) through a translation-dependent mechanism involving target of rapamycin ({TOR}). The pyloric dilator ({PD}) neuron exclusively expresses D2Rs. Micromolar {DA} produces an immediate hyperpolarizing shift in {PD} {IA} voltage dependence of activation, whereas tonic {DA} persistently decreases {PD} {IA} Gmax through a translation-dependent mechanism not involving {TOR}. The persistent effects on {IA} Gmax do not depend on {LP} or {PD} activity.

	abstract = {Volume transmission results in phasic and tonic modulatory signals. The actions of tonic dopamine ({DA}) at type 1 {DA} receptors (D1Rs) are largely undefined. Here we show that tonic 5nM {DA} acts at D1Rs to stabilize neuronal output over minutes by enabling activity-dependent regulation of the hyperpolarization activated current (I h). In the presence but not absence of 5nM {DA}, I h maximal conductance (G max) was adjusted according to changes in slow wave activity in order to maintain spike timing. Our study on the lateral pyloric neuron ({LP}), which undergoes rhythmic oscillations in membrane potential with depolarized plateaus, demonstrated that incremental, bi-directional changes in plateau duration produced corresponding alterations in {LP} I {hG} max when preparations were superfused with saline containing 5nM {DA}. However, when preparations were superfused with saline alone there was no linear correlation between {LP} I {hGmax} and duty cycle. Thus, tonic {nM} {DA} modulated the capacity for activity to modulate {LP} I h G max; this exemplifies metamodulation (modulation of modulation). Pretreatment with the Ca2+-chelator, {BAPTA}, or the specific {PKA} inhibitor, {PKI}, prevented all changes in {LP} I h in 5nM {DA}. Calcineurin inhibitors blocked activity-dependent changes enabled by {DA} and revealed a {PKA}-mediated, activity-independent enhancement of {LP} I {hG} max. These data suggested that tonic 5nM {DA} produced two simultaneous, {PKA}-dependent effects: a direct increase in {LP} I h G max and a priming event that permitted calcineurin regulation of {LP} I h. The latter produced graded reductions in {LP} I {hG} max with increasing duty cycles. We also demonstrated that this metamodulation preserved the timing of {LP}'s first spike when network output was perturbed with bath-applied 4AP. In sum, 5nM {DA} permits slow wave activity to provide feedback that maintains spike timing, suggesting that one function of low-level, tonic modulation is to stabilize specific features of a dynamic output.},

Using the pyloric network in the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, we show that dopamine ({DA}) does not simply alter circuit output, but activates a closed loop in which {DA}-induced alterations in circuit output consequently drive a change in an ionic conductance to preserve a conductance ratio and its activity correlate. {DA} acted at low affinity type 1 receptors (D1Rs) to induce an immediate modulatory decrease in the transient potassium current ({IA}) of a pyloric neuron. This, in turn, advanced the activity phase of that component neuron, which disrupted its network function and thereby destabilized the circuit. {DA} simultaneously acted at high affinity D1Rs on the same neuron to confer activity-dependence upon the hyperpolarization activated current (Ih) such that the {DA}-induced changes in activity subsequently reduced Ih. This {DA}-enabled, activity-dependent, intrinsic plasticity exactly compensated for the modulatory decrease in {IA} to restore the {IA}:Ih ratio and neuronal activity phase, thereby closing an open loop created by the modulator. Activation of closed loops to preserve conductance ratios may represent a fundamental operating principle neuromodulatory systems use to ensure stability in their target networks.},

In addition, neuromodulators can exert effects at multiple timescales, from short-term adjustments of neuron and synapse function to persistent long-term regulation.

	abstract = {The pyloric network of decapods crustaceans can undergo dramatic rhythmic activity changes. Under normal conditions the network generates low frequency rhythmic activity that depends obligatorily on the presence of neuromodulatory input from the central nervous system. When this input is removed (decentralization) the rhythmic activity ceases. In the continued absence of this input, periodic activity resumes after a few hours in the form of episodic bursting across the entire network that later turns into stable rhythmic activity that is nearly indistinguishable from control (recovery). It has been proposed that an activity-dependent modification of ionic conductance levels in the pyloric pacemaker neuron drives the process of recovery of activity. Previous modeling attempts have captured some aspects of the temporal changes observed experimentally, but key features could not be reproduced. Here we examined a model in which slow activity-dependent regulation of ionic conductances and slower neuromodulator-dependent regulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration reproduce all the temporal features of this recovery. Key aspects of these two regulatory mechanisms are their independence and their different kinetics. We also examined the role of variability (noise) in the activity-dependent regulation pathway and observe that it can help to reduce unrealistic constraints that were otherwise required on the neuromodulator-dependent pathway. We conclude that small variations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a Ca2+ uptake regulation mechanism that is directly targeted by neuromodulator-activated signaling pathways, and variability in the Ca2+ concentration sensing signaling pathway can account for the observed changes in neuronal activity. Our conclusions are all amenable to experimental analysis.},

	abstract = {Rhythm generation by the pyloric motor network in the stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}) of the spiny lobster requires permissive neuromodulatory inputs from other central ganglia. When these inputs to the {STG} are suppressed by cutting the single, mainly afferent stomatogastric nerve (stn), pyloric neurons cease to burst and the network falls silent. However, as shown previously, if such a decentralized quiescent ganglion is maintained in organ culture, pyloric network rhythmicity returns after 3-4 days and, although slower, is similar to the motor pattern expressed when the stn is intact. Here we use current- and voltage-clamp, primarily of identified pyloric dilator ({PD}) neurons, to investigate changes in synaptic and cellular properties that underlie this transition in network behavior. Although the efficacy of chemical synapses between pyloric neurons decreases significantly (by {\textless}or=50\%) after {STG} decentralization, the fundamental change leading to rhythm recovery occurs in the voltage-dependent properties of the neurons themselves. Whereas pyloric neurons, including the {PD}, lateral pyloric, and pyloric cell types, are unable to generate burst-producing membrane potential oscillations in the short-term absence of extrinsic modulatory inputs, in long-term decentralized ganglia, the same cells are able to oscillate spontaneously, even after experimental isolation in situ from all other elements in the pyloric network. In {PD} neurons this reacquisition of rhythmicity is associated with a net reduction in outward tetraethylammonium-sensitive ionic currents that include a delayed-rectifier type potassium current (I(Kd)) and a calcium-dependent K(+) current, I({KCa}). By contrast, long-term {STG} decentralization caused enhancement of a hyperpolarization-activated inward current that resembles I(h). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that modulatory inputs sustain the modulation-dependent rhythmogenic character of the pyloric network by continuously regulating the balance of membrane conductances that underlie neuronal oscillation.},

We found that target genes fall into two classes: promoters bound by few factors tend to be inactive or repressed, whereas promoters bound by more than four factors are largely active in the pluripotent state and become repressed upon differentiation.

In the kainate model of continuous seizures in rat, we find a loss of Kv2.1 clustering in pyramidal neurons in vivo. Biochemical analysis of Kv2.1 in the brains of these rats shows a marked dephosphorylation of Kv2.1. In cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons, glutamate stimulation rapidly causes dephosphorylation of Kv2.1, translocation of Kv2.1 from clusters to a more uniform localization, and a shift in the voltage-dependent activation of I(K). An influx of Ca(2+) leading to calcineurin activation is both necessary and sufficient for these effects.

In vitro calcineurin digestion shows that supersensitivity of S603 dephosphorylation is an inherent property of Kv2.1. Conversely, suppression of neuronal activity by anesthetic in vivo causes hyperphosphorylation at S603 but not S563. Distinct regulation of individual phosphorylation sites allows for graded and bidirectional homeostatic regulation of Kv2.1 function.

However, it is still unclear whether early regulators are re-deployed in subtype-specific combinatorial codes, and whether early patterning events act to restrict the developmental potential of postmitotic cells. Here, we use the differential peptidergic fate of two lineage-related peptidergic neurons in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord to show how, in a feedforward mechanism, earlier determinants become critical players in later combinatorial codes. Amongst the progeny of neuroblast 5–6 are two peptidergic neurons: one expresses {FMRFamide} and the other one expresses Nplp1 and the dopamine receptor {DopR}. We show the {HLH} gene collier functions at three different levels to progressively restrict neuronal identity in the 5–6 lineage. At the final step, collier is the critical combinatorial factor that differentiates two partially overlapping combinatorial codes that define {FMRFamide} versus Nplp1/{DopR} identity. Misexpression experiments reveal that both codes can activate neuropeptide gene expression in vast numbers of neurons. Despite their partially overlapping composition, we find that the codes are remarkably specific, with each code activating only the proper neuropeptide gene. These results indicate that a limited number of regulators may constitute a potent combinatorial code that dictates unique neuronal cell fate, and that such codes show a surprising disregard for many global instructive cues.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that a significant component of expression variability arises from extrinsic factors thought to influence multiple genes simultaneously, yet the biological origins of this extrinsic variability have received little attention. Here we combine computational modelling with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.},

This description reflects the inherently stochastic nature of gene expression, known to be a major factor in the heterogeneous response of individual cells within a clonal population to an inducing stimulus. Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise) arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in contrast to observations in prokaryotes, and that such noise can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show that pulsatile {mRNA} production, through reinitiation, is crucial for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency, highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell-cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation.},

	abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

All these models produced very similar outputs to current injections, including tiny details of the complex firing pattern. These models were not completely isolated in the parameter space, but neither did they belong to a large continuum of good models that would exist if weak compensations between channels were sufficient. The parameter landscape of good models can best be described as a set of loosely connected hyperplanes. Our method is efficient in finding good models in this complex landscape.

To explore the relationship between conductances, and in particular how they influence the activity of motor neurons in the well characterized leech heartbeat system, we developed a new multi-compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley style leech heart motor neuron model. To do so, we evolved a population of model instances, which differed in the density of specific conductances, capable of achieving specific output activity targets given an associated input pattern. We then examined the sensitivity of measures of output activity to conductances and how the model instances responded to hyperpolarizing current injections. We found that the strengths of many conductances, including those with differing dynamics, had strong partial correlations and that these relationships appeared to be linked by their influence on heart motor neuron activity. Conductances that had positive correlations opposed one another and had the opposite effects on activity metrics when perturbed whereas conductances that had negative correlations could compensate for one another and had similar effects on activity metrics.},

	abstract = {Many species of cold-blooded animals experience substantial and rapid fluctuations in body temperature. Because biological processes are differentially temperature dependent, it is difficult to understand how physiological processes in such animals can be temperature robust [1-8]. Experiments have shown that core neural circuits, such as the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}), exhibit robust neural activity in spite of large (20°C) temperature fluctuations [3, 5, 7, 8]. This robustness is surprising because (1) each neuron has many different kinds of ion channels with different temperature dependencies (Q10s) that interact in a highly nonlinear way to produce firing patterns and (2) across animals there is substantial variability in conductance densities that nonetheless produce almost identical firing properties. The high variability in conductance densities in these neurons [9, 10] appears to contradict the possibility that robustness is achieved through precise tuning of key temperature-dependent processes. In this paper, we develop a theoretical explanation for how temperature robustness can emerge from a simple regulatory control mechanism that is compatible with highly variable conductance densities [11-13]. The resulting model suggests a general mechanism for how nervous systems and excitable tissues can exploit degenerate relationships among temperature-sensitive processes to achieve robust function.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental evidence suggests that coordinated expression of ion channels plays a role in constraining neuronal electrical activity. In particular, each neuronal cell type of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion exhibits a unique set of positive linear correlations between ionic membrane conductances. These data suggest a causal relationship between expressed conductance correlations and features of cellular identity, namely electrical activity type. To test this idea, we used an existing database of conductance-based model neurons. We partitioned this database based on various measures of intrinsic activity, to approximate distinctions between biological cell types. We then tested individual conductance pairs for linear dependence to identify correlations. Contrary to experimental evidence, in which all conductance correlations are positive, 32\% of correlations seen in this database were negative relationships. In addition, 80\% of correlations seen here involved at least one calcium conductance, which have been difficult to measure experimentally. Similar to experimental results, each activity type investigated had a unique combination of correlated conductances. Finally, we found that populations of models that conform to a specific conductance correlation have a higher likelihood of exhibiting a particular feature of electrical activity. We conclude that regulating conductance ratios can support proper electrical activity of a wide range of cell types, particularly when the identity of the cell is well-defined by one or two features of its activity. Furthermore, we predict that previously unseen negative correlations and correlations involving calcium conductances are biologically plausible.},

The "tumor microenvironment" ({TM}) is formed by mesenchymal, endothelial, and immune cells immersed in a network of extracellular matrix ({ECM}) proteins and soluble factors. The {TM} strongly contributes to tumor progression, through long distance, cell-to-cell or cell-to-matrix signals, which influence different aspects of tumor cell behavior. Understanding the relationships among the different components of the cancer tissue is crucial to design and develop new therapeutic strategies. Ion channels are emerging as relevant players in the cross talk between tumor cells and their {TM}. Ion channels are expressed on tumor cells, as well as in the different cellular components of the {TM}. In all these cells, ion channels are in a strategic position to sense and transmit extracellular signals into the intracellular machinery. Often, this transmission is mediated by integrin adhesion receptors, which can be functional partners of ion channels since they form molecular complexes with the channel protein in the context of the plasma membrane. The same relevant role is exerted by ion transporters, which also contribute to determine two facets of the cancer tissue: hypoxia and the acidic extracellular {pH}. On the whole, it is conceivable to prospect the targeting of ion channels for new therapeutic strategies aimed at better controlling the malignant progression of the cancer tissue.},

For example, while previous experiments with some K(V) channels suggest that the association of the pore-subunit with the accessory subunits occurs co-translationally in the endoplasmic reticulum, it is not known whether {KCNQ}1 assembly with {KCNE}1 occurs in a similar manner to generate the medically important cardiac slow delayed rectifier current (I(Ks)). In this study we used a novel approach to demonstrate that purified recombinant human {KCNE}1 protein ({prKCNE}1) modulates {KCNQ}1 channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes resulting in generation of I(Ks). Incubation of {KCNQ}1-expressing oocytes with cycloheximide did not prevent I(Ks) expression following {prKCNE}1 injection. By contrast, incubation with brefeldin A prevented {KCNQ}1 modulation by {prKCNE}1. Moreover, injection of the trafficking-deficient {KCNE}1-L51H reduced {KCNQ}1 currents. Together, these observations indicate that while assembly of {KCNE}1 with {KCNQ}1 does not require co-translation, functional {KCNQ}1-{prKCNE}1 channels assemble early in the secretory pathway and reach the plasma membrane via vesicular trafficking.},

The cac channels contribute to low- and high-threshold, fast- and slow-inactivating types of Ca2+ currents, take part in membrane depolarization, and strongly activate Ca2+-activated K+ current [I(K(Ca))]. In cac neurons, unexpectedly, voltage-activated transient K+ current I(A) is upregulated to a level that matches I(K(Ca)) reduction, implicating a homeostatic regulation that was mimicked by chronic pharmacological blockade of Ca2+ currents in wild-type neurons.

	abstract = {Homeostatic control of neural function can be mediated by the regulation of ion channel expression, neurotransmitter receptor abundance, or modulation of presynaptic release. These processes can be implemented through cell autonomous or intercellular signaling. It remains unknown whether different forms of homeostatic regulation can be coordinated to achieve constant neural function. One way to approach this question is to confront a simple neural system with conflicting perturbations and determine whether the outcome reflects a coordinated, homeostatic response. Here we demonstrate that two A-type potassium channel genes, shal and shaker, are reciprocally, transcriptionally coupled to maintain A-type channel expression. We then demonstrate that this homeostatic control of A-type channel expression prevents target-dependent, homeostatic modulation of synaptic transmission. Thus, we uncover a novel homeostatic mechanism that reciprocally regulates A-type potassium channels and we define a hierarchical relationship between cell-intrinsic control of ion channel expression and target-derived homeostatic control of synaptic transmission.},

Given a set mean firing rate, it should self-organize to respond with high firing rates only to comparatively rare events. Here we derive an unsupervised learning rule that continuously adapts membrane conductances of a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron to optimize the representation of sensory information in the firing rate. Maximizing information transfer between the stimulus and the cell's firing rate can be interpreted as a non-Hebbian developmental mechanism.},

	abstract = {The fast transient potassium or A current ({IA}) plays an important role in determining the activity of central pattern generator neurons. We have previously shown that the shal K+ channel gene encodes {IA} in neurons of the pyloric network in the spiny lobster. To further study how {IA} shapes pyloric neuron and network activity, we microinjected {RNA} for a shal-{GFP} fusion protein into four identified pyloric neuron types. Neurons expressing shal-{GFP} had a constant increase in {IA} amplitude, regardless of cell type. This increase in {IA} was paralleled by a concomitant increase in the hyperpolarization-activated cation current Ih in all pyloric neurons. Despite significant increases in these currents, only modest changes in cell firing properties were observed. We used models to test two hypotheses to explain this failure to change firing properties. First, this may reflect the mislocalization of the expressed shal protein solely to the somata and initial neurites of injected neurons, rendering it electrically remote from the integrating region in the neuropil. To test this hypothesis, we generated a multicompartment model where increases in {IA} could be localized to the soma, initial neurite, or neuropil/axon compartments. Although spike activity was somewhat more sensitive to increases in neuropil/axon versus somatic/primary neurite {IA}, increases in {IA} limited to the soma and primary neurite still evoked much more dramatic changes than were seen in the shal-{GFP}-injected neurons. Second, the effect of the increased {IA} could be compensated by the endogenous increase in Ih. To test this, we modeled the compensatory increases of {IA} and Ih with a cycling two-cell model. We found that the increase in Ih was sufficient to compensate the effects of increased {IA}, provided that they increase in a constant ratio, as we observed experimentally in both shal-injected and noninjected neurons. Thus an activity-independent homeostatic mechanism maintains constant neuronal activity in the face of dramatic increases in {IA}.},

Accompanying the increase in I(A) is a dramatic and linearly correlated increase in the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(h)). The enhanced I(h) electrophysiologically compensates for the enhanced I(A), since pharmacological blockade of I(h) uncovers the physiological effects of the increased I(A). Expression of a nonfunctional mutant Shal also induces a large increase in I(h), demonstrating a novel activity-independent coupling between the Shal protein and I(h) enhancement.

The contribution of neuronal activity to brain plasticity was first recognized in relation to critical periods of development, when manipulating the sensory environment was found to profoundly affect neuronal morphology and receptive field properties. Since then, a growing body of evidence has established that brain plasticity extends beyond development and is an inherent feature of adult brain function, spanning multiple domains, from learning and memory to adaptability of primary sensory maps. Here we discuss evolution of the current view that plasticity of the adult brain derives from dynamic tuning of transcriptional control mechanisms at the neuronal level, in response to external and internal stimuli. We then review the identification of "plasticity genes" regulated by changes in the levels of electrical activity, and how elucidating their cellular functions has revealed the intimate role transcriptional regulation plays in fundamental aspects of synaptic transmission and circuit plasticity that occur in the brain on an every day basis.},

	abstract = {Neuronal excitability has a large impact on network behavior, and plasticity in intrinsic excitability could serve as an important information storage mechanism. Here we ask whether postsynaptic excitability of layer V pyramidal neurons from primary visual cortex can be rapidly regulated by activity. Whole cell current-clamp recordings were obtained from visual cortical slices, and intrinsic excitability was measured by recording the firing response to small depolarizing test pulses. Inducing neurons to fire at high-frequency (30-40 Hz) in bursts for 5 min in the presence of synaptic blockers increased the firing rate evoked by the test pulse. This long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability ({LTP}-{IE}) lasted for as long as we held the recording ({\textgreater}60 min). {LTP}-{IE} was accompanied by a leftward shift in the entire frequency versus current (F-I) curve and a decrease in threshold current and voltage. Passive neuronal properties were unaffected by the induction protocol, indicating that {LTP}-{IE} occurred through modification in voltage-gated conductances. Reducing extracellular calcium during the induction protocol, or buffering intracellular calcium with bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, prevented {LTP}-{IE}. Finally, blocking protein kinase A ({PKA}) activation prevented, whereas pharmacological activation of {PKA} both mimicked and occluded, {LTP}-{IE}. This suggests that {LTP}-{IE} occurs through postsynaptic calcium influx and subsequent activation of {PKA}. Activity-dependent plasticity in intrinsic excitability could greatly expand the computational power of individual neurons.},

We will consider the evidence for persistent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability — what we will call intrinsic plasticity — that is produced by training in behaving animals and by artificial patterns of activation in brain slices and neuronal cultures. These intrinsic changes might function as part of the engram itself, or as a related phenomenon such as a trigger for the consolidation or adaptive generalization of memories.},

Synaptic plasticity is not the exclusive mode of regulation of information processing in the brain, and persistent regulations of ionic conductances in some specialized neuronal areas such as the dendrites, the cell body, and the axon could also modulate, in the long-term, the propagation of neuronal information. Persistent changes in intrinsic excitability have been reported in several brain areas in which activity is elevated during a classical conditioning. The role of synaptic activity seems to be a determinant in the induction, but the learning rules and the underlying mechanisms remain to be defined. We discuss here the role of synaptic activity in the induction of intrinsic plasticity in cortical, hippocampal, and cerebellar neurons. Activation of glutamate receptors initiates a long-term modification in neuronal excitability that may represent a parallel, synergistic substrate for learning and memory. Similar to synaptic plasticity, long-lasting intrinsic plasticity appears to be bidirectional and to express a certain level of input or cell specificity. These nonsynaptic forms of plasticity affect the signal propagation in the axon, the dendrites, and the soma. They not only share common learning rules and induction pathways with the better-known synaptic plasticity such as {NMDA} receptor dependent {LTP} and {LTD}, but also contribute in synergy with these synaptic changes to the formation of a coherent engram.},

We next investigated how the axonal {mRNA} pool changes after axotomy, revealing that numerous gene transcripts related to intracellular transport, mitochondria and the cytoskeleton show decreased localization 2 d after injury. In contrast, gene transcripts related to axonal targeting and synaptic function show increased localization in regenerating cortical axons, suggesting that there is an increased capacity for axonal outgrowth and targeting, and increased support for synapse formation and presynaptic function in regenerating {CNS} axons after injury. Our data demonstrate that {CNS} axons contain many {mRNA} species of diverse functions, and suggest that, like invertebrate and {PNS} axons, {CNS} axons synthesize proteins locally, maintaining a degree of autonomy from the cell body.},

Incorporating morphological detail into a model allows for additional analysis of non-homogeneous distributions of active and synaptic conductances, as well as spatial segregation of electrical events. We developed a morphologically detailed “Full Model” of a leech heart interneuron that replicates reasonably well intracellular recordings from these interneurons. However, it comprises hundreds of compartments, each increasing parameter space and simulation time. To reduce the number of compartments of the Full Model, while preserving conductance densities and distributions, its compartments were grouped into functional groups that each share identical conductance densities. Each functional group was sequentially reduced to one or two compartments, preserving surface area, conductance densities and its contribution to input resistance. As a result, the input resistance and membrane time constant were preserved. The axial resistances of several compartments were rescaled to match the amplitude of synaptic currents and low-threshold calcium currents and the shape of action potentials to those in the Full Model. This reduced model, with intrinsic conductances, matched the activity of the Full Model for a variety of simulated current-clamp and voltage-clamp data. Because surface area and conductance distribution of the functional groups of the Full Model were maintained, parameter changes introduced into the reduced model can be directly translated to the Full Model. Thus, our computationally efficient reduced morphology model can be used as a tool for exploring the parameter space of the Full Model and in network simulations.},

A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

We present a model of a stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}) neuron in which several Ca2+-dependent pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca2+ sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity ∼90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the {STG}. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cerebellar Purkinje neurons often generate all-or-none burst firing in response to depolarizing stimuli. Voltage-clamp experiments using action potential waveforms show that burst firing depends on small net inward currents that flow after spikes and reflect the net balance between multiple large currents. Given this, burst firing is surprisingly robust in the face of changes in the magnitude of the underlying currents from cell to cell. We explored the basis of this robustness by examining the effects of reducing the sodium current, the major contributor to the postspike inward current. Burst firing persisted in concentrations of tetrodotoxin that produced half-block of sodium current. This robustness of bursting reflects an acute feedback mechanism whereby waveform changes from the reduced sodium current (reduced spike height and a hyperpolarizing shift in postspike voltage) cause compensatory decreases in postspike potassium currents. In particular, reduced spike height reduces calcium entry and subsequent calcium-activated potassium current, and the hyperpolarizing shift in postspike voltage speeds deactivation of Kv3-like potassium channels. Other experiments examined bursting in Na$_{\textrm{v}}$1.6$^{\textrm{-/-}}$ mice, in which sodium current density is reduced in the long term. Under these circumstances, there was upregulation of both T-type and P-type calcium current and a change in the balance of calcium current and calcium-activated potassium current such that their net influence shifted from being inhibitory during bursts in wild-type neurons to excitatory during bursts from Na$_{\textrm{v}}$1.6$^{\textrm{-/-}}$ mutant neurons. Thus, Purkinje neurons have both acute and long-term feedback mechanisms that serve to maintain burst firing when voltage-dependent sodium conductance is reduced.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The activity of dopaminergic ({DA}) substantia nigra ({SN}) neurons is essential for voluntary movement control. An intrinsic pacemaker in {DA} {SN} neurons generates their tonic spontaneous activity, which triggers dopamine release. We show here, by combining multiplex and quantitative real-time single-cell {RT}- {PCR} with slice patch-clamp electrophysiology, that an A-type potassium channel mediated by Kv4.3 and {KChip}3 subunits has a key role in pacemaker control. The number of active A-type potassium channels is not only tightly associated with the pacemaker frequency of individual {DA} {SN} neurons, but is also highly correlated with their number of Kv4.3L (long splice variant) and {KChip}3.1 (long splice variant) {mRNA} molecules. Consequently, the variation of Kv4alpha and Kv4beta subunit transcript numbers is sufficient to explain the full spectrum of spontaneous pacemaker frequencies in identified {DA} {SN} neurons. This linear coupling between Kv4alpha as well as Kv4beta {mRNA} abundance, A-type channel density and pacemaker frequency suggests a surprisingly simple molecular mechanism for how {DA} {SN} neurons tune their variable firing rates by transcriptional control of ion channel genes.},

Here we describe a rapid compensatory interaction among a pair of potassium currents, {IA} and {IKCa}, that stabilizes both intrinsic excitability and network function in the cardiac ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis. We determined that {mRNA} levels in single identified neurons for the channels which encode {IA} and {IKCa} are positively correlated, yet the ionic currents themselves are negatively correlated, across a population of motor neurons. We then determined that these currents are functionally coupled; decreasing levels of either current within a neuron causes a rapid increase in the other. This functional interdependence results in homeostatic stabilization of both the individual neuronal and the network output. Furthermore, these compensatory increases are mechanistically independent, suggesting robustness in the maintenance of neural network output that is critical for survival. Together, we generate a complete model for homeostatic plasticity from {mRNA} to network output where rapid post-translational compensatory mechanisms acting on a reservoir of channels proteins regulated at the level of gene expression provide homeostatic stabilization of both cellular and network activity.},

Our approach is based on the implicit function theorem and is applicable to activity characteristics that smoothly depend on parameters. Such smoothness is often intrinsic to neuronal systems when they are in stable functional states. The conclusions about how parameters compensate each other, developed in this study, can thus be used even without regard to the specific mathematical model describing a particular neuron or neuronal network. We showed that near a generic point in the parameter space there are infinitely many other points, or parameter combinations, for which specified characteristics of activity are the same as in the original point. These parameter combinations form a smooth manifold. This manifold can be extended as long as the gradients of characteristics are defined and independent. All possible variations of parameters compensating each other are simply all possible charts of the same manifold. The number of compensating parameters (but not parameters themselves) is fixed and equal to the number of the independent characteristics maintained. The algorithm that we developed shows how to find compensatory functional dependencies between parameters numerically. Our method can be used in the analysis of the homeostatic regulation, neuronal database search, model tuning and other applications.},

Recently, several forms of homeostatic plasticity that stabilize the properties of neural circuits have been identified. These include mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability, stabilize total synaptic strength, and influence the rate and extent of synapse formation. These forms of homeostatic plasticity are likely to go 'hand-in-glove' with Hebbian mechanisms to allow experience to modify the properties of neuronal networks selectively.},

Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression ({LTP} and {LTD}), in which synaptic strengths change in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to mechanisms that regulate the total synaptic strength of a neuron. Here we describe a new form of synaptic plasticity that increases or decreases the strength of all of a neuron's synaptic inputs as a function of activity. Chronic blockade of cortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents ({mEPSCs}) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking {GABA} (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over a 48-hour period {mESPC} amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were at least partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate, and apparently affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Such 'synaptic scaling' may help to ensure that firing rates do not become saturated during developmental changes in the number and strength of synaptic inputs, as well as stabilizing synaptic strengths during Hebbian modification and facilitating competition between synapses.},

When first plated in culture, these neurons had few active properties. After 1 d in culture they produced small action potentials that rapidly inactivated during maintained depolarization. After 2 d in culture they fired large action potentials tonically when depolarized, and their properties resembled very closely the properties of {STG} neurons pharmacologically isolated in the ganglion. After 3-4 d in culture, however, their electrical properties changed and they fired in bursts when depolarized. We characterized the currents expressed by these neurons in culture. They included two {TTX}-sensitive sodium currents, a calcium current, a delayed-rectifier-like current, a calcium-dependent potassium current, and two A-type currents. The changes in firing properties with time in culture were accompanied by an increase in inward and decrease in outward current densities. A single-compartment conductance-based model of an {STG} neuron was constructed by fitting the currents measured in the biological neurons. When the current densities in the model neuron were matched to those measured for the biological neurons in each activity state, the model neuron closely reproduced each state, indicating that the changes in current densities are sufficient to account for the changes in intrinsic properties. These data indicate that {STG} neurons isolated in culture change their intrinsic electrical properties by selectively adjusting the magnitudes of their ionic conductances.},

	abstract = {Neurons exhibit long-term excitability changes necessary for maintaining proper cell and network activity in response to various inputs and perturbations. For instance, the adult crustacean pyloric network can spontaneously recover rhythmic activity after complete shutdown resulting from permanent removal of neuromodulatory inputs. Dissociated lobster stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}) neurons have been shown to spontaneously develop oscillatory activity via excitability changes. Rhythmic electrical stimulation can eliminate these oscillatory patterns in some cells. The ionic mechanisms underlying these changes are only partially understood. We used dissociated crab {STG} neurons to study the ionic mechanisms underlying spontaneous recovery of rhythmic activity and stimulation-induced activity changes. Similar to lobster neurons, rhythmic activity spontaneously develops in crab {STG} neurons. Rhythmic hyperpolarizing stimulation can eliminate, but more commonly accelerate, the emergence of stable oscillatory activity depending on Ca2+ influx at hyperpolarized voltages. Our main finding is that upregulation of a Ca2+ current and downregulation of a high-threshold K+ current underlies the spontaneous homeostatic development of oscillatory activity. However, because of a nonlinear dependence on stimulus frequency, hyperpolarization-induced oscillations appear to be inconsistent with a homeostatic regulation of activity. We find no difference in the activity patterns or the underlying ionic currents involved between neurons of the fast pyloric and the slow gastric mill networks during the first 10 days in isolation. Dynamic-clamp experiments confirm that these conductance modifications can explain the observed activity changes. We conclude that spontaneous and stimulation-induced excitability changes in {STG} neurons can both result in intrinsic oscillatory activity via regulation of the same two conductances.},

	abstract = {Different Shaker family α-subunit genes generate distinct voltage-dependent K+ currents when expressed in heterologous expression systems. Thus it generally is believed that diverse neuronal K+ current phenotypes arise, in part, from differences in Shaker family gene expression among neurons. It is difficult to evaluate the extent to which differential Shaker family gene expression contributes to endogenous K+ current diversity, because the specific Shaker family gene or genes responsible for a given K+ current are still unknown for nearly all adult neurons. In this paper we explore the role of differential Shaker family gene expression in creating transient K+ current ({IA}) diversity in the 14-neuron pyloric network of the spiny lobster,Panulirus interruptus. We used two-electrode voltage clamp to characterize the somatic {IA} in each of the six different cell types of the pyloric network. The size, voltage-dependent properties, and kinetic properties of the {somaticIA} vary significantly among pyloric neurons such that the somatic {IA} is unique in each pyloric cell type. Comparing these currents with {theIAs} obtained from oocytes injected {withPanulirus} shaker and shal {cRNA} ({lobsterIshaker} and {lobsterIshal}, respectively) reveals that the pyloric cell {IAs} more closely resemble lobster Ishal than {lobsterIshaker}. Using a novel, quantitative single-cell-reverse transcription-{PCR} method to count the number of shal transcripts in individual identified pyloric neurons, we found that the size of the {somaticIA} varies linearly with the number of endogenous shal transcripts. These data suggest that theshal gene contributes substantially to the peak {somaticIA} in all neurons of the pyloric network.},

At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

	abstract = {We studied the functional role and modulation of the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) in the pyloric network of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. In isolated neurons, Ih is a small current with a hyperpolarized voltage of half-activation ({VAct}) and a slow time constant of activation (τAct). Bath application of dopamine ({DA}), octopamine ({OCT}), or serotonin (5HT) modified Ih in selected synaptically isolated pyloric neurons. {DA} significantly enhanced Ih in the anterior burster ({AB}) neuron by depolarizing its {VAct}, accelerating its τAct, and enhancing its maximal conductance (gmax). {DA} more weakly enhanced Ih in the pyloric constrictor ({PY}) and ventricular dilator ({VD}) neurons. {OCT} weakly depolarized {VAct} and accelerated τAct in the {VD} and inferior cardiac ({IC}) neurons. 5HT depolarized {VAct} in the {IC} neuron. Under control conditions with intact modulatory inputs from other ganglia, the pyloric rhythm cycles strongly at about 1–2 Hz. Bath application of the Ih blocker cesium (Cs+) caused a mean increase in the period of 8\%, although this effect was highly variable. When Cs+ was applied to an isolated ganglion where the pyloric rhythm had been activated only by {DA}, the cycle period was consistently increased by 13.5\%, with no other strong changes in rhythm parameters. These results suggest that Ih regulates the pyloric rhythm by accelerating {AB} pacemaker frequency, but that this effect can vary with the modulatory conditions.},

	abstract = {The pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis, slows or stops when descending modulatory inputs are acutely removed. However, the rhythm spontaneously resumes after one or more days in the absence of neuromodulatory input. We recorded continuously for days to characterize quantitatively this recovery process. Activity bouts lasting 40–900 s began several hours after removal of neuromodulatory input and were followed by stable rhythm recovery after 1–4 days. Bout duration was not related to the intervals (0.3–800 min) between bouts. During an individual bout, the frequency rapidly increased and then decreased more slowly. Photoablation of back-filled neuromodulatory terminals in the stomatogastric ganglion ({STG}) neuropil had no effect on activity bouts or recovery, suggesting that these processes are intrinsic to the {STG} neuronal network. After removal of neuromodulatory input, the phase relationships of the components of the triphasic pyloric rhythm were altered, and then over time the phase relationships moved toward their control values. Although at low pyloric rhythm frequency the phase relationships among pyloric network neurons depended on frequency, the changes in frequency during recovery did not completely account for the change in phase seen after rhythm recovery. We suggest that activity bouts represent underlying mechanisms controlling the restructuring of the pyloric network to allow resumption of an appropriate output after removal of neuromodulatory input.},

Synaptic as well as intrinsic conductances can be regulated to make a self-assembling central pattern generator network; thus, network-level homeostasis can emerge from cell-autonomous regulation rules. Finally, we demonstrate that the outcome of homeostatic regulation depends on the complement of ion channels expressed in cells: in some cases, loss of specific ion channels can be compensated; in others, the homeostatic mechanism itself causes pathological loss of function.},

Using generic model neurons, we show that correlated conductance expression can emerge from simple homeostatic control mechanisms that couple expression rates of individual conductances to cellular readouts of activity. The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to “antihomeostatic” regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

To determine whether balances of intrinsic currents potentially resulting from such correlations preserve certain electrical cell outputs, we developed a nominal biophysical model of the crustacean cardiac ganglion using biological data. Predictions from the nominal model showed that coregulation of ionic currents may preserve the key characteristics of motor neuron activity.

Despite the substantial amount of data consistent with this idea, a direct biological demonstration that cells with conserved output, particularly within the same network, achieve these outputs via different solutions has been difficult to achieve. Here we demonstrate definitively that neurons from native neural networks with highly similar output achieve this conserved output by differentially tuning underlying conductance magnitudes. Multiple motor neurons of the crab (Cancer borealis) cardiac ganglion have highly conserved output within a preparation, despite showing a 2–4-fold range of conductance magnitudes. By blocking subsets of these currents, we demonstrate that the remaining conductances become unbalanced, causing disparate output as a result. Therefore, as strategies to understand neuronal excitability become increasingly sophisticated, it is important that such variability in excitability of neurons, even among those within the same individual, is taken into account.},

Neurons have been classified by morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical techniques. More recently, molecular approaches, particularly microarray, have been applied to the question of neuronal identity. With the realization that proteins expressed exclusively in only one type of neuron are rare, expression profiles obtained from neuronal subtypes are analyzed to search for diagnostic patterns of gene expression. However, this expression profiling hinges on one critical and implicit assumption: that neurons of the same type in different animals achieve their conserved functional output via conserved levels and quantitative relationships of gene expression. Here we exploit the unambiguously identifiable neurons in the crab stomatogastric ganglion to investigate the precise quantitative expression profiling of neurons at the level of single-cell ion channel expression. By measuring absolute {mRNA} levels of six different channels in the same individually identified neurons, we demonstrate that not only do individual cell types possess highly variable levels of channel expression but that this variability is constrained by unique patterns of correlated channel expression.},

	abstract = {Neurons generate cell-specific outputs via interactions of conductances carried by ion channel proteins that are homeostatically regulated to maintain key quantitative relationships among subsets of conductances. Given the challenges of both normal channel protein turnover and short-term plasticity, how is the balance of membrane conductances maintained over long-term timescales to ensure stable electrophysiological phenotype? One possible mechanism is to dynamically regulate production of channel protein via feedback that constrains relationships at the channel {mRNA} level. Recent modeling work has postulated that such {mRNA} relationships could emerge as a result of activity-dependent homeostatic tuning rules that ensure an appropriate ratio of {mRNA} for key ion channels is maintained to preserve robust cellular output. Yet, this has never been demonstrated in biological neurons. In this study, we quantified multiple ion channel {mRNAs} from single identified motor neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion to determine whether correlations among channel {mRNAs} are actively maintained, and, if so, by what form of feedback. In these neurons, we identified correlations among {mRNAs} for voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels. By performing experiments that decoupled activity, synaptic connectivity, and neuromodulatory state, we determined that correlated channel {mRNAs} are maintained by an activity-dependent process. This is the first study to demonstrate that distinct relationships across channel {mRNAs} are dynamically maintained in an activity-dependent manner. This feedback from cellular activity to coordinated transcriptome-level interactions represents a novel aspect of regulation of neuronal output with implications for long-term stability of neuron function.},

However, each {STG} cell type had a unique combination of ion channel correlations.

	abstract = {Identified neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis were voltage-clamped, and the current densities of three K+ currents were measured. The current densities of each of the three K+ currents varied twofold to fivefold in inferior cardiac ({IC}) neurons from different animals. Conventionally, this degree of variability has been attributed to experimental artifacts. Instead, we suggest that it reflects a natural variability that may be related to an underlying process of plasticity. First, we found that there is no fixed ratio among the three K+ currents. Second, we found that several hours of stimulation with depolarizing current pulses (0.5 sec duration at 1 Hz) altered the current density of the Ca2+-dependent outward current, {IK}(Ca), and the transient outward current, {IA}. This stimulation paradigm mimics the normal pattern of activity for these neurons. The effect of stimulation on the {IA} current density was eliminated when Ca2+ influx was blocked by extracellular Cd2+. In contrast, the K+ current densities of the lateral pyloric ({LP}) neuron were unaffected by the same pattern of stimulation, and the currents expressed by both the {IC} and the {LP} neurons were insensitive to hyperpolarizing pulses at the same frequency. We conclude that the conductance densities expressed by neurons may vary continually depending on the recent history of electrical activity in the preparation, and that intracellular Ca2+ may play a role in the processes by which activity influences the regulation of current densities in neurons.},

	abstract = {Neuronal identity depends on the regulated expression of numerous molecular components, especially ionic channels, which determine the electrical signature of a neuron. Such regulation depends on at least two key factors, activity itself and neuromodulatory input. Neuronal electrical activity can modify the expression of ionic currents in homeostatic or nonhomeostatic fashion. Neuromodulators typically modify activity by regulating the properties or expression levels of subsets of ionic channels. In the stomatogastric system of crustaceans, both types of regulation have been demonstrated. Furthermore, the regulation of the coordinated expression of ionic currents and the channels that carry these currents has been recently reported in diverse neuronal systems, with neuromodulators not only controlling the absolute levels of ionic current expression but also, over long periods of time, appearing to modify their correlated expression. We hypothesize that neuromodulators may regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at multiple levels and in a cell-type-dependent fashion. We report that in two identified neuronal types, three ionic currents are linearly correlated in a pairwise manner, suggesting their coexpression or direct interactions, under normal neuromodulatory conditions. In each cell, some currents remain correlated after neuromodulatory input is removed, whereas the correlations between the other pairs are either lost or altered. Interestingly, in each cell, a different suite of currents change their correlation. At the transcript level we observe distinct alterations in correlations between channel {mRNA} amounts, including one of the cell types lacking a correlation under normal neuromodulatory conditions and then gaining the correlation when neuromodulators are removed. Synaptic activity does not appear to contribute, with one possible exception, to the correlated expression of either ionic currents or of the transcripts that code for the respective channels. We conclude that neuromodulators regulate the correlated expression of ion channels at both the transcript and the protein levels.},

	abstract = {Ionic currents, whether measured as conductance amplitude or as ion channel transcript numbers, can vary many-fold within a population of identified neurons. In invertebrate neuronal types multiple currents can be seen to vary while at the same time their magnitudes are correlated. These conductance amplitude correlations are thought to reflect a tight homeostasis of cellular excitability that enhances the robustness and stability of neuronal activity over long stretches of time. Although such ionic conductance correlations are well documented in invertebrates, they have not been reported in vertebrates. Here we demonstrate with two examples, identified mouse hippocampal granule cells ({GCs}) and cholinergic basal forebrain neurons, that the correlation of ionic conductance amplitudes between different ionic currents also exists in vertebrates, and we argue that it is a ubiquitous phenomenon expressed by many species across phyla. We further demonstrate that in dentate gyrus {GCs} these conductance correlations are likely regulated in a circadian manner. This is reminiscent of the known conductance regulation by neuromodulators in crustaceans. However, in {GCs} we observe a more nuanced regulation, where for some conductance pairs the correlations are completely eliminated while for others the correlation is quantitatively modified but not obliterated.},

	abstract = {Although rapid-onset, short-term regulation of neuronal Ca currents by neurotransmitters and second messengers is well documented, little is known about conditions that can cause longer-lasting changes in Ca channel function. We report here that persistent depolarization is accompanied by slowly developing long-term reduction of neuronal Ca currents. Rat myenteric neurons grown in cell culture for 1–7 d were studied with the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Macroscopic Ca-channel currents had decaying and sustained components at all days studied. When the neurons were grown in medium containing 25 {mM} {KCl}, which depolarized them to -40 {mV} and caused significant elevation of intracellular Ca, the densities of both components of Ca-channel current decreased by 40–80\%. Several results suggest that different mechanisms underlie the downregulation of the two components. (1) The density of the decaying component decreased approximately four times faster than did that of the sustained component. (2) When neurons were returned to control medium, which contained 5 {mM} {KCl}, the density of the sustained component returned to control levels within 24 hr, while that of the decaying component did not recover significantly. (3) Inhibitors of {RNA} and protein synthesis reduced or prevented downregulation of the sustained but not of the decaying component. (4) The dihydropyridine antagonist nitrendipine, which prevented the sustained elevation of intracellular Ca in neurons grown in 25 {mM} {KCl}, prevented downregulation of the sustained component but had no effect on downregulation of the decaying component. We suggest that these forms of regulation of Ca current density could help neurons adapt to altered levels of electrical activity and may contribute to changes in synaptic strength that occur during periods of increased or decreased electrical activity.},

	abstract = {In order to maintain stable functionality in the face of continually changing input, neurones in the {CNS} must dynamically modulate their electrical characteristics. It has been hypothesized that in order to retain stable network function, neurones possess homeostatic mechanisms which integrate activity levels and alter network and cellular properties in such a way as to counter long-term perturbations. Here we describe a simple model system where we investigate the effects of sustained neuronal depolarization, lasting up to several days, by exposing cultures of primary hippocampal pyramidal neurones to elevated concentrations (10–30 mm) of {KCl}. Following exposure to {KCl}, neurones exhibit lower input resistances and resting potentials, and require more current to be injected to evoke action potentials. This results in a rightward shift in the frequency-input current ({FI}) curve which is explained by a simple linear model of the subthreshold I–V relationship. No changes are observed in action potential profiles, nor in the membrane potential at which action potentials are evoked. Furthermore, following depolarization, an increase in subthreshold potassium conductance is observed which is accounted for within a biophysical model of the subthreshold I–V characteristics of neuronal membranes. The {FI} curve shift was blocked by the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine, whilst antagonism of {NMDA} receptors did not interfere with the effect. Finally, changes in the intrinsic properties of neurones are reversible following removal of the depolarizing stimulus. We suggest that this experimental system provides a convenient model of homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability, and permits the study of temporal characteristics of homeostasis and its dependence on stimulus magnitude.},

We discuss this plasticity at three levels: rapid homeostatic changes in membrane conductance, longer-term effects of neuromodulation on excitability, and the impacts of activity-dependent feedback on steady-state channel {mRNA} levels. We then conclude with thoughts on the implications of plasticity of excitability for variability of conductance levels across populations of motor neurons.},

	abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

In this way, homeostatic signaling is thought to constrain neural plasticity and contribute to the stability of neural function over time. Using a restrictive definition of homeostasis, this review first evaluates the phenomenological and molecular evidence for homeostatic signaling in the nervous system. Then, basic principles underlying the design and molecular implementation of homeostatic signaling are reviewed on the basis of work in other, simplified biological systems such as bacterial chemotaxis and the heat shock response. Data from these systems are then discussed in the context of homeostatic signaling in the nervous system.},

This is unsurprising as Hebbian plasticity constitutes the most fully developed and influential model of how information is stored in neural circuits and how neural circuitry can develop without extensive genetic instructions. Yet Hebbian plasticity may not be sufficient for understanding either learning or development: the dramatic changes in synapse number and strength that can be produced by this kind of plasticity tend to threaten the stability of neural circuits. Recent work has suggested that, in addition to Hebbian plasticity, homeostatic regulatory mechanisms are active in a variety of preparations. These mechanisms alter both the synaptic connections between neurons and the intrinsic electrical properties of individual neurons, in such a way as to maintain some constancy in neuronal properties despite the changes wrought by Hebbian mechanisms. Here we review the evidence for homeostatic plasticity in the central nervous system, with special emphasis on results from cortical preparations.},

Most studies of long-term changes in synaptic strength have concentrated on Hebbian mechanisms, where these changes occur in a synapse-specific manner. While Hebbian mechanisms are important for modifying neuronal circuitry selectively, they might not be sufficient because they tend to destabilize the activity of neuronal networks. Recently, several forms of homeostatic plasticity that stabilize the properties of neural circuits have been identified. These include mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability, stabilize total synaptic strength, and influence the rate and extent of synapse formation. These forms of homeostatic plasticity are likely to go 'hand-in-glove' with Hebbian mechanisms to allow experience to modify the properties of neuronal networks selectively.},

Our approach builds on the tradition of uniting the speed of languages like C++ with the ease-of-use and feature-set of scientific programming languages like {MATLAB}. Xolotl allows for the creation and manipulation of hierarchical models with components that are named and searchable, permitting intuitive high-level programmatic control over all parts of the model. The simulator's architecture allows for the interactive manipulation of any parameter in any model, and for visualizing the effects of changing that parameter immediately. Xolotl is fully featured with hundreds of ion channel models from the electrophysiological literature, and can be extended to include arbitrary conductances, synapses, and mechanisms. Several core features like bookmarking of parameters and automatic hashing of source code facilitate reproducible and auditable research. Its ease of use and rich visualization capabilities make it an attractive option in teaching environments. Finally, xolotl is written in a modular fashion, includes detailed tutorials and worked examples, and is freely available at https://github.com/sg-s/xolotl, enabling seamless integration into the workflows of other researchers.},
